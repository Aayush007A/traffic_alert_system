There are several ways to make
travelling safe and one is through the Traffic Police. Responsibility of the traffic Police regarding traffic management
includes directing traffic, enforcing traffic rules and regulations and penalizing the driver in case of violating traffic rules.
Another way of enforcing traffic discipline is frequent conduction of awareness program, from the Department of Traffic
Police, based on the offence data collected. But the existing system do not have centralized repository for storing the
penalized data, so this project work is an attempt to develop an android application which will help the traffic police to record
the penalty information in the centralized repository. Application to be developed will also consist of analysis part of traffic
offences based on which higher authorities can take necessary measures regarding traffic discipline.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In recent years, the quantity of motor vehicles
increases rapidly and the burden of the management of
the road traffic are increasingly heavy. There are
several ways to make travelling safe and one is
through the Traffic Police. Responsibility of the traffic
Police regarding traffic management includes
enforcing traffic rules and regulations and penalizing
the driver in case of violating traffic rules. In today's
information-rich society, everything is becoming
smart. This project shows the design and development
of smart traffic offence analysis tool with e-payment. </p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Traffic Alert management is a major concern in
cities around the world. Mobilized Traffic Offence
System is a powerful mobile based application that
records all the traffic offences committed citywide.
The application helps the traffic police keep adequate
information of all traffic offences that has been
committed by road users and also maintain the
databases of the driver and vehicle details.We have
many existing android applications that helps the
vehicle driver to check his challan status and he can
pay the penalty online without the intervention of
traffic police .but our application focuses on traffic
police as user and he can penalize the one who
commits the traffic offence and can collect the penalty
amount on spot using e-payment .with the information
stored in the database the higher authorities can take
appropriate measures <br></p>
